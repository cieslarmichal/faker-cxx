How to contribute
=================


Getting Started
---------------

-  Pick a feature from the [TODO Features](https://github.com/cieslarmichal/faker-cxx/blob/main/TODO.md) or pick an issue from [Issues](https://github.com/cieslarmichal/faker-cxx/issues)
-  Fork the repository on GitHub

Making Changes
--------------

-  Create a feature/bug branch from main branch:

   ``git checkout -b feature/feature-name`` or ``git checkout -b bug/issue-name``.
   
   Please avoid working directly on the ``main`` branch.
-  Make commits of logical units.
-  Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes.
-  Run *all* the tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.

Submitting Changes
------------------

-  Push your changes to the branch in your fork of the repository.
-  Submit a pull request to the repository.
